\title{Generate Rankings for All Measures in a Set of CSV Files}
\usage{
ranking.for.all.measures(
  folder.names.csv,
  measure.names,
  my.methods,
  folders,
  results.mm
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder.names.csv}{A vector of file names (without path) for the CSV files
to be processed.}

\item{measure.names}{A vector of names corresponding to the measures to be 
used for filtering rankings.}

\item{my.methods}{A vector of method names that will be used as column names 
for the DataFrame created from the CSV files.}

\item{folders}{A list containing folder paths for different stages of saving 
results. This should include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{folder.csvs}: Path where the input CSV files are located.
  \item \code{folder.rankings}: Path where individual ranking results should be saved.
  \item \code{folder.all.rankings}: Path where all ranking averages should be saved.
  \item \code{folder.media.rankings}: Path where mean ranking results should be saved.
}}

\item{results.mm}{A list containing results with measures data, which includes
information needed to determine which ranking method to apply.}
}
\value{
A list containing the rankings calculated for each CSV file, organized
  by the original filenames.
}
\description{
This function processes a list of CSV files, computes rankings based on
various measures, and saves the results in specified directories. It handles
different tie-breaking methods and saves both individual and aggregated
ranking results. The function also generates mean rankings for both "0"
and "1" categories, and stores these in separate files.
}
\details{
The function processes each CSV file listed in \code{folder.names.csv}, 
applies the specified measures to generate rankings, and saves the results
to the directories specified in \code{folders}. Rankings are saved with 
prefixes "0-" and "1-" to indicate the categories. Mean rankings for both 
categories are also computed and saved.
