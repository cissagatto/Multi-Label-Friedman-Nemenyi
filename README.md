# Multi-Label-Friedman-Nemenyi
This repository provides a practical implementation of the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests specifically tailored for multi-label classification problems. These techniques are essential for evaluating and comparing the performance of multiple algorithms in experiments where each instance may belong to several classes simultaneously.
